# Defense of Linux Phones

On privacy forums, I often see https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html be recommended if linux mobile operating systems such as Ubuntu Touch, Mobian, or postmarketOS are proposed. This website states some security deficiencies of linux mobile operating systems. However, linux phones still have better privacy then stock android which this website recommends. 

Security != privacy. This website shows security problems, not privacy problems. Security does affect privacy as it makes it easier for attackers to read data, but security measures do not prevent leaking data by design. Stock android sends lots of data to Google and phone makers. Security measures do not prevent this - security measures don't fix built in spyware.  A example is Google Play Services.

>  They do not have security features such as full system MAC policies, verified boot, hardened kernels, strong app sandboxing etc. that modern Android phones do. 

Verified boot is something that locks yourself out of control of your own phone. Android verified boot only allows booting the kernel provided by the vendor, which prevents you from controlling your phone's kernel. Android verified boot would be acceptable if you could add your own keys and remove the vendor keys. Hardened kernels do not prevent Google from collecting data about you and neither does sandboxing. Why should we trust Google's app sandboxing for preventing their own software from phoning home?
