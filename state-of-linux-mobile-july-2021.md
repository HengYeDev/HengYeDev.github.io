# State of Linux on Mobile in July 2021

As a developer of Linux mobile OS ports and apps, I'd like to give an overview of the state of Linux on mobile platforms today. 

## A note on Android

Many say that "Android is Linux" since it uses a Linux kernel. However, it has a drastically different userspace and philosophy to it. It also uses a heavily
modified Linux kernel which is not mainlined. Many manufacturers violate the GPL by not making their forks open source. This article will only be discussing
the new Linux mobile platforms which have a more traditional unix/linux userspace.
