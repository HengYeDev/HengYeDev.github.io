# State of Linux on Mobile in July 2021

As a developer of Linux mobile OS ports and apps, I'd like to give an overview of the state of Linux on mobile platforms today. 

## A note on Android

Many say that "Android is Linux" since it uses a Linux kernel. However, it has a drastically different userspace and philosophy to it. It also uses a heavily
modified Linux kernel which is not mainlined. Many manufacturers violate the GPL by not making their forks open source. This article will only be discussing
the new Linux mobile platforms which have a more traditional unix/linux userspace. 

## Why run Linux on your phone?

* If you like tinkering with technology
* If you want an OS that does not have the influence of monoploies such as Apple and Google
* If you want an OS that behaves more like a desktop OS
* If you want to run powerful desktop appliccations
* If you want a more lightweight OS
* If you want to try out different user interfaces
* If you want "convergence" - plugging in your device into a monitor to use it as a desktop computer

...a linux phone might be for you.

## Hardware

There are now more hardware than ever that can run traditional Linux environments. For a phone or tablet to be able to run traditional Linux, it is 
important that the kernel and firmware are open source so they can be adapted. Some phones are designed to run Linux while others are shipped with Android
and are "ported" to run other platforms. It is mandatory that the phone have an unlockable bootloader. 

### Designed to run Linux

There are some phones which mostly emerged in the past 2-3 years that are designed to run open source mobile platforms. The main options are the Pine64 PinePhone and the Purism Librem 5. These phones are not very performant and are designed to be developer devices.
