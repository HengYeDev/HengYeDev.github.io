# The Costs of Convergence

I see that many popular Linux phones such as the F(x)tec Pro1-X, the PinePhone, and the Librem 5 have a convergence feature in which when you
connect the smartphone to a docking station or an external monitor, you can use it as a desktop or laptop computer. Modern smartphones often have
as much memory and storage as a desktop Linux box, so this is a reasonable use case. But is it save more money then purchasing a laptop?

The laptop docks which I will analyze are the [NexDock Touch](https://nexdock.com/) and the [HP Elite X3 Lapdock](https://www.amazon.com/HP-V8H07UT-Elite-Lap-Dock/dp/B01M14FYYU).
The NexDock Touch is priced at $269 as of the time of writing, and the X3 Lapdock is priced at $299. The Linux smartphones I will use to compare are the Pine64 
PinePhone, priced at $199 for the convergence edition, the Librem 5, currently priced at $749, and the F(x)tec Pro1-X, also priced at $749.
